User: Hi, I'm curious about the human brain. What are its main parts?

AI: Hello! The human brain is incredibly complex. Its main parts include the cerebrum, which is responsible for higher functions like thought and voluntary action; the cerebellum, which handles coordination and balance; and the brainstem, which controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate.

User: How does the brain learn and store memories?

AI: The brain learns and stores memories through the formation and strengthening of connections between neurons, called synapses. This process is known as synaptic plasticity. When you learn something new or recall a memory, these connections are activated and reinforced.
